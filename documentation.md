# Explanation for Repo and Process #
-------
## Python --> GitHub Repo ##
1. [Upload this .html](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17R3cvV2HyaKwBCTiBdtOAR_-BCkNgx_b/view?usp=sharing) which is the converted **.html** file for diff_jade_style_edits.py. Name it "save.index.html"
2. Upload *another* copy of the diff_jade_style_edits.html file, **deleting** the !DOCTYPE html and name it "diff_jade_style_edits.html"
3. You should now have in your **main** repo **two files**: "save.index.html" with full .html code; & "diff_jade_style_edits.html" without the doctype
## GitHub Repo --> Pages ##
[I used this link tutorial] (https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) after the repo creation step to set up an active website
  - After choosing a theme, go to **index.md**. This is what appears on your website.
  - Delete all of the text (i chose minimal theme bc it was most convenient) and add ONLY the output display text from [this .py code] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CHYJx3YsSG9KNunToCzKuJB0VGLrN0MK/view?usp=sharing)
    - Add div class wrappers, which are readable in the current index.md RAW version
- You should now have the "index.md" with your display files for the site, and the two copies of the HTML code saved respectively in the main branch
  - Run your Pages and you should generate a site with the correct displayed Jade texts
